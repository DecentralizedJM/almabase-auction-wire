# Silent Auctions – Landing Page Wireframe (Lovable)

This repository contains the low-fidelity landing page wireframe created for the proposed **Almabase Silent Auctions** product. The purpose of this wireframe is to visually communicate the user experience, value propositions, and product flow derived from customer discovery conversations and secondary research on gala-style fundraising events.

## 📌 Overview

Silent auctions at universities are still largely run through paper bid sheets and improvised workflows. The wireframe illustrates how a **unified, mobile-first, AlmaBase-native** solution can streamline the entire process for bidders, event staff, and advancement teams.

This project focuses on structure, clarity, and messaging rather than final UI polish. All components follow Almabase’s existing design language.
